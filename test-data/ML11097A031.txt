OFFICIAL USE ONLY - SECURITY-RELATED INFORMATION April 4, 2011 Mr. Tom Kirwin Vice-President, Operations (Acting) Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. Palisades Nuclear Plant 27780 Blue Star Memorial Highway Covert, MI 49043-9530 SUBJECT: PALISADES NUCLEAR PLANT NRC SECURITY BASELINE INSPECTION REPORT 05000255/2011403(DRS)

Dear Mr. Kirwin: On March 4, 2011, the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) completed a security baseline inspection at your Palisades Nuclear Plant. The inspection covered one or more of the key attributes of the security cornerstone of the NRC's Reactor Oversight Process. The enclosed inspection report documents the inspection results, which were discussed on March 4, 2011, with you and other members of your staff. The inspection examined activities conducted under your license as they relate to security and compliance with the Commission's rules and regulations and with the conditions of your license. The inspector reviewed selected procedures and records, observed activities, and interviewed personnel. This report documents one NRC-identified finding of very low security significance (i.e., Green as determined by the Physical Protection Significance Determination Process) and associated violation of NRC requirements. The deficiencies were promptly corrected or compensated for, and the plant was in compliance with applicable physical protection and security requirements within the scope of this inspection before the inspector left the site. The one finding had a cross-cutting aspect in the area of Human Performance, Decision Making (H.1(b)), because the licensee failed to conduct effectiveness reviews of safety significant decisions to verify the validity of the underlying assumptions and identify possible unintended consequences. The NRC is treating this violation as Non-Cited Violations (NCV) consistent with Section 2.3.2 of the NRC Enforcement Policy because of the very low security significance of the violation and because it was entered into your corrective action program. Additionally, two licensee-identified violations, which were determined to be of very low security significance, are listed in this report. The NRC is treating these violations a NCVs consistent with Section 2.3.2 of the NRC Enforcement Policy because of the very low security significance of the violations and because they were entered into your corrective action program.
Enclosure contains Sensitive Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information. When separated from enclosure, this transmittal document is decontrolled.
