SUMMARY OF FINDINGS Grand Gulf Nuclear Station NRC Inspection Report No. 50-416/00-04 The report covers a 6-week period of resident inspection and announced inspections by regional radiation specialists. The significance of issues is indicated by their color (green, white, yellow, or red) and was determined by the significance determination process in Inspection Manual Chapter 0609. Cornerstone: Occupational Radiation Safety · Green. The inspectors identified that the licensee failed to adequately survey items released from the controlled access area. Specifically, the licensee failed to evaluate the presence of hard-to-detect radionuclides. The failure to adequately survey items could result in the release of licensed material. This violation of 10 CFR 20.1501(a) is being treated as a noncited violation, consistent with Section VI.A of the NRC Enforcement Policy. This violation is in the licensee's corrective action program as Condition Report CR-GGN-2000-0479 (Section 2OS3). This issue was characterized as a "green" finding based on the occupational radiation safety significance determination process which indicated that the violation had very low risk significance because the violation did not result in public dose greater than 0.005 rem and there were no more than five events.

Report Details Summary of Plant Status: During this inspection period, the plant operated at 100 percent power, with the exception of minor power reductions for control valve testing and control rod pattern adjustments. 1.

b.

Issues and Findings The inspectors found that the licensee had not evaluated portable frisking instruments and tool monitors to determine their capability in detecting all radionuclides that could be released from the controlled access area. To determine which radionuclides should have been considered in such an evaluation, the inspectors reviewed the latest dry active waste stream analysis. The dry active waste stream analysis was used to classify radioactive waste, in accordance with 10 CFR 61.55, and it indicated the types and relative abundance of radionuclides present as contamination in the licensee's facility. This analysis, conducted independently by a vendor laboratory, confirmed that over 82.5 percent of radioactivity in the waste stream resulted from the presence of iron-55. Iron-55 decays by electron capture and emits only a low energy x-ray. This makes iron-55 hard to detect with the Geiger-Mueller and plastic scintillation survey instruments used by the licensee. The inspectors determined that the licensee had evaluated the effect of the hard-todetect nuclides such as iron-55 on personnel dose (committed effective dose equivalent which was evaluated through whole body counting) and documented compensatory actions in a position paper (GIN 2000-00095). However, the licensee had not evaluated the ability of survey instruments to identify all radionuclides that might be present on items released from its control. Without this evaluation, the licensee could not ensure that release surveys were adequately performed. 10 CFR 20.1003 defines a survey as a means of evaluation of radiological conditions and potential hazards. 10 CFR 20.1501(a) requires each licensee to make, or cause to be made, surveys that may be necessary for the licensee to comply with the regulations in 10 CFR Part 20 and are reasonable under the circumstances to evaluate the extent of radiation levels, concentration or quantities of radioactive material, and the potential radiological hazards that could be present. In this case, surveys were necessary for the licensee to comply with 10 CFR 20.2001, which requires that the licensee dispose of licensed material only in specified ways. The licensee's failure to adequately survey items released from the controlled access area was a violation of 10 CFR 20.1501(a). This violation was processed through the

-8Public Radiation Safety Significance Determination Process because it was a radioactive material control issue. However, because it did not result in public dose greater than 0.005 rem, and there were no more than five events, the violation had very little effect on safety. This violation is being treated as a noncited violation, consistent with Section VI.A of the NRC Enforcement Policy. This violation is in the licensee's corrective action program as Condition Report CR-GGN-2000-0479 (50-416/0004-01). 4 OTHER ACTIVITIES

4OA1 Performance Indicator Verification a. Inspection Scope The inspectors verified the accuracy and completeness of the data used to calculate and report the following performance indicators for the four quarters in 1999: · · · · · Unplanned scrams per 7,000 critical hours of operation, Scrams with a loss of normal heat removal, Unplanned power changes per 7,000 critical hours, Occupational Exposure Control Effectiveness, and Radiological Effluent Technical Specifications/Offsite Dose Calculation Manual Radiological Effluent.

The inspectors reviewed licensee event reports, monthly operating reports, and NRC inspection reports to complete the verification of the first three performance indicators. The inspectors reviewed corrective action program records for restricted high radiation areas, very high radiation areas, and unplanned exposure occurrences for the past 12 months to confirm that these occurrences were properly included in performance indicator data. Selected examples of controlled access area exit transactions with exposures greater than 100 millirem for the past 12 months were reviewed to determine whether they were within the dose projections of the governing radiation work permits. Additionally, radiological effluent release program corrective action records, licensee event reports, and annual effluent release reports were reviewed to determine if any events exceeded the performance indicator thresholds. b. Issues and Findings The inspectors did not identify any errors or findings.

-94OA2 Identification and Resolution of Problems a. Inspection Scope The inspectors interviewed cognizant licensee personnel and reviewed the following items: · Licensee self-assessments and audits, focusing on radiological incidents that involved personnel internal exposures, and Selected exposure-significant radiological incidents that involved radiation monitoring instrument deficiencies since the last inspection in this area.

·

In addition to this, the inspectors reviewed one quality program surveillance and 10 condition reports written since January 1, 1999. The audits, surveillance, and condition reports were reviewed for repetitive or significant deficiencies to determine if identified problems were properly characterized, entered into the corrective action program, and resolved in a timely manner. b. Issues and Findings The inspectors did not identify any findings. 4OA6 Meetings .1 Exit Meeting Summary The inspectors presented the inspection results for the review of radiological monitoring instrumentation to Mr. C. A. Bottemiller and other members of licensee management at the conclusion of the inspection on April 6, 2000.

ATTACHMENT 2 NRC'S REVISED REACTOR OVERSIGHT PROCESS The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) revamped its inspection, assessment, and enforcement programs for commercial nuclear power plants. The new process takes into account improvements in the performance of the nuclear industry over the past 25 years and improved approaches of inspecting safety performance at NRC licensed plants. The new process monitors licensee performance in three broad areas (called strategic performance areas): reactor safety (avoiding accidents and reducing the consequences of accidents if they occur), radiation safety (protecting plant employees and the public during routine operations), and safeguards (protecting the plant against sabotage or other security threats). The process focuses on licensee performance within each of seven cornerstones of safety in the three areas: Reactor Safety ·Initiating Events ·Mitigating Systems ·Barrier Integrity ·Emergency Preparedness Radiation Safety ·Occupational ·Public Safeguards ·Physical Protection

To monitor these seven cornerstones of safety, the NRC used two processes that generate information about the safety significance of plant operations: inspections and performance indicators. Inspection findings will be evaluated according to their potential significance for safety, using the significance determination process, and assigned colors of GREEN, WHITE, YELLOW, or RED. GREEN findings are indicative of issues that, while they may not be desirable, represent very low safety significance. WHITE findings indicate issues that are of low to moderate safety significance. YELLOW findings are issues that are of substantial safety significance. RED findings represent issues that are of high safety significance with a significant reduction in safety margin. Performance indicator data will be compared to established criteria for measuring licensee performance in terms of potential safety. Based on prescribed thresholds, the indicators will be classified by color representing varying levels of performance and incremental degradation in safety: GREEN, WHITE, YELLOW, or RED. GREEN indicators represent performance at a level requiring no additional NRC oversight beyond the baseline inspections. WHITE corresponds to performance that may result in increased NRC oversight. YELLOW represents performance that minimally reduces safety margin and requires even more NRC oversight. And RED indicates performance that represents a significant reduction in safety margin but still provides adequate protection to public health and safety. The assessment process integrates performance indicators and inspection so the agency can reach objective conclusions regarding overall plant performance. The agency will use an Action Matrix to determine in a systematic, predictable manner which regulatory actions should be taken based on a licensee's performance. The NRC's actions in response to the significance (as represented by the color) of issues will be the same for performance indicators as for inspection findings. As a licensee's safety performance degrades, the NRC will take more and increasingly significant action, which can include shutting down a plan, as described in the

-2Action Matrix. More information can be found at: http:\\www.nrc.gov\NRR\OVERSIGHT\index.html.
